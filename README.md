# Web-Based Interactive Avatar Library

A modular and high-performance web library for creating interactive avatars on websites.
The avatars can interact with text elements on a page, providing a unique and engaging user experience.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **3D Avatar Integration** – Easily embed animated avatars into any webpage.
- **Interactive Physics** – Avatars can collide and interact with text and page elements.
- **Custom Models & Animations** – Supports custom 3D models, textures, and animation states.
- **Lightweight & Modular** – Built with performance and extensibility in mind.
- **Developer-Friendly API** – Simple setup and intuitive functions.

---

## 📌 Project Plan & Milestones

1. **Project Setup & Architecture** ✅

   - Defined project structure and modular architecture.

2. **Core Engine Development**

   - Game loop (`Game.js`) for orchestrating updates.
   - `Scene.js` manager using **Three.js**.
   - Lightweight `Physics.js` engine for collisions.

3. **Avatar & Animation**

   - `Avatar.js` for character properties and movement.
   - `AnimationManager.js` for smooth state transitions.
   - `ModelLoader.js` for loading 3D models and textures.

4. **Text Collision System**

   - Scans and generates collision boundaries for text.
   - Self-corrects with dynamic content changes.

5. **Integration & API**

   - Simple API for embedding avatars into any site.
   - Clear developer documentation.

6. **Testing & Optimization**

   - Performance testing and cross-browser support.
   - Optimization for minimal page load impact.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The library uses a **modular architecture** for extensibility and maintainability.

### Components

- **Game Engine (`Game.js`)** – Core loop, input handling, and component communication.
- **Scene Manager (`Scene.js`)** – Three.js powered rendering engine.
- **Physics Engine (`Physics.js`)** – Collision detection with text and objects.
- **Avatar (`Avatar.js`)** – Manages avatar properties, animations, and interactions.
- **Loaders (`ModelLoader.js`, `TextureLoader.js`)** – Asset loading utilities.
- **Animation Manager (`AnimationManager.js`)** – Handles animation states and transitions.
- **Utilities (`helpers.js`)** – Common helper functions.

- `add(object)` – Add objects to the scene.
- `render()` – Render scene each frame.

### `Physics.js`

- `constructor()` – Initialize physics system.
- `generateCollisionBoundaries()` – Detect text boundaries.
- `detectCollisions()` – Check for collisions.

### `Avatar.js`

- `constructor()` – Create new avatar instance.
- `update()` – Update position & animation.
- `jump()`, `moveLeft()`, `moveRight()` – Avatar actions.

### `AnimationManager.js`

- `constructor()` – Initialize animations.

## 🔄 Component Interaction

1. **Initialization** – `Game` sets up `Scene`, `Physics`, and `Avatar`.
2. **Asset Loading** – Models & textures via `ModelLoader`; animations via `AnimationManager`.
3. **Collision Detection** – `Physics` generates boundaries and checks interactions.
4. **User Interaction** – Input events drive avatar actions.
5. **Rendering** – `Scene` continuously updates & renders.
